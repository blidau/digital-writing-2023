RMIT University Digital Writing Lab notes and exercises

## Class Resources

- [Reading list on Canvas](https://rmit.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/61RMIT_INST/lists/42941256810001341?auth=SAML)
- [Class handbook](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/110237/pages/class-handbook-digital-writing)

## Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

In the slides, there are links to RMIT resources and you will also see a breakdown of the weeks on what we will cover.

We went through a [list of expectations everyone has for the class](expectations.md) and we will revisit this list at the end of the semester.

In class we created a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and did the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). We then created a GitHub repository called `digital-writing-folio` added two files, `readings.md` and `exercises.md`. In `exercises.md` we answered the questions:

- What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

You should return to the last two questions throughout the semester as you use new tools in your writing practice and as you think about your final project.

The `readings.md` file you should use to keep notes on your readings of the essays/chapters in the reading list and any works of electronic literature you read.

We read either "Taroko Gorge" and "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution" or "Shade" and briefly discussed initial impressions of the work. In week 2 we will discuss them in more detail and in relation to print works.

## Before Week 2

Look at the works in the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/) and read at least 3 that you find interesting (make sure to note the works you look at in your digital writing folio). You must pick one of these works for your Individual Case Study to present in week 4. The selection should be finalised with me by the end of class week 2. You'll likely have more success with the works in later volumes. The only work you can't select is "The Durham Poems" in volume 4.

## Week 2

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The fiction game [Depression Quest](http://www.depressionquest.com/)
2. The [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) story [Under a Star Called Sun](https://haraiva.itch.io/under-a-star-called-sun)
